As previously described in the [Web3 Provider Explained](https://0xproject.com/wiki#Web3-Provider-Explained) section of the wiki, we at 0x have created a number of useful Web3 sub providers. These sub providers aren't only useful for 0x.js, they can be added to any application to provide resiliency, usability and to support hardware wallet functionality.

You can install the 0x sub providers package as follows:

```
npm install @0xproject/subproviders --save
```

The sub providers work best when they are composed together using the [Web3 Provider Engine](https://github.com/MetaMask/provider-engine). This can be installed as follows:

```
npm install web3@0.20.4 web3-provider-engine --save
```

In the first example, we will make use of a browser extension wallet (e.g [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)) composed with an Ethereum node we control. This set up allows all of the account based activity (signing of messages and sending transactions) to route to the browser extension wallet, while allowing the data fetching requests to flow through to a specific Ethereum node of our choosing.

```typescript
import * as Web3 from 'web3';
import Web3ProviderEngine = require('web3-provider-engine');
import { promisify } from '@0xproject/utils';
import { InjectedWeb3Subprovider } from '@0xproject/subproviders';
import { ZeroEx } from '0x.js';

const KOVAN_NETWORK_ID = 42;
// Create a Web3 Provider Engine
const providerEngine = new Web3ProviderEngine();
// Compose our Providers, order matters
// Use the InjectedWeb3Subprovider to wrap the browser extension wallet
providerEngine.addProvider(new InjectedWeb3Subprovider(window.web3.currentProvider));
// Use an RPC provider to route all other requests
providerEngine.addProvider(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'));
providerEngine.start();

const web3 = new Web3(providerEngine);
// Optional, use with 0x.js
const zeroEx = new ZeroEx(providerEngine, { networkId: KOVAN_NETWORK_ID });
const accounts = await promisify<string>(web3.eth.getAccounts)();
console.log(accounts);
```

Using the configuration above, all account related requests (e.g signing and sending a transaction) go through the browser extension wallet. All other data fetching requests go through the RPC Sub provider. This example is great as an application can use their own synced Ethereum node, rather than relying on Metamask or Infura uptime.

Within the 0x Sub provider package, we have also added a [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/start/ledger-nano-s) sub provider. By adding this sub provider first into the Web3 Provider Engine, we are able to route all account based requests to the Ledger. We again use the RPC Provider for all other requests.

```typescript
import * as Web3 from 'web3';
import Web3ProviderEngine = require('web3-provider-engine');
import { promisify } from '@0xproject/utils';
import {
    ledgerEthereumBrowserClientFactoryAsync as ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync,
    LedgerSubprovider,
} from '@0xproject/subproviders';
import { ZeroEx } from '0x.js';

const KOVAN_NETWORK_ID = 42;
// Create a Web3 Provider Engine
const providerEngine = new Web3ProviderEngine();
// Compose our Providers, order matters
// Use the Ledger Subprovider to intercept all account based requests
const ledgerSubprovider = new LedgerSubprovider({
    networkId: KOVAN_NETWORK_ID,
    ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync,
});
providerEngine.addProvider(ledgerSubprovider);
// Use an RPC provider to route all other requests
providerEngine.addProvider(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'));
providerEngine.start();

const web3 = new Web3(providerEngine);
// Optional, use with 0x.js
const zeroEx = new ZeroEx(providerEngine, { networkId: KOVAN_NETWORK_ID });
const accounts = await promisify<string>(web3.eth.getAccounts)();
console.log(accounts);
```

This above example works for enabling the Ledger Sub provider in Browser based applications, if you want to use the Ledger directly in a Node.js application, you must use a different `ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync`, for example:

```typescript
// Import the NodeJS Client Factory, rather than the Browser Client Factory
import {
    ledgerEthereumNodeJsClientFactoryAsync as ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync,
    LedgerSubprovider,
} from '@0xproject/subproviders';
```

The Ledger Sub provider has a number of public methods and can be used directly to set various options. For example, the derivation path and the account index can be changed.

```typescript
public getPath(): string
public setPath(derivationPath: string)
public setPathIndex(pathIndex: number)
public async getAccountsAsync(): Promise<string[]>
public async signTransactionAsync(txParams: PartialTxParams): Promise<string>
public async signPersonalMessageAsync(data: string): Promise<string>
```

### Notes on Ledger Sub provider

It is important to remember that UI components and UX need to be considered when adding the hardware wallet support to your application. A few examples that require additional thought:

* The user may have multiple accounts on the hardware wallet. The first account may not be the desired one
* The user may want to set the a higher gas price so the transaction has a higher probability of being mined
* The hardware device is limited to handling one request at a time
* The hardware device is not capable of showing the message entirely on screen. An application [should confirm](https://github.com/ethfinex/0x-order-verify) what is displayed on the device

In our last example we will add redundancy to the application by making use of the RedundantRPCSubprovider. The RedundantRPCSubprovider helps your application stay up when underlying Ethereum nodes experience network issues. To use this sub provider, simply provide it with a list of Ethereum node RPC endpoints and it will attempt each one in sequence until a successful response is returned.

```typescript
import * as Web3 from 'web3';
import Web3ProviderEngine = require('web3-provider-engine');
import { promisify } from '@0xproject/utils';
import {
    InjectedWeb3Subprovider,
    RedundantRPCSubprovider
} from '@0xproject/subproviders';

const KOVAN_NETWORK_ID = 42;
// Create a Web3 Provider Engine
const providerEngine = new Web3ProviderEngine();
// Compose our Providers, order matters
// Use the InjectedWeb3Subprovider to wrap the browser extension wallet
providerEngine.addProvider(new InjectedWeb3Subprovider(window.web3.currentProvider));
// Use the RedundantRPCSubprovider to route all other requests
providerEngine.addProvider(new RedundantRPCSubprovider(['http://localhost:8545', 'https://kovan.infura.io/'));
providerEngine.start();

const web3 = new Web3(providerEngine);
const gasPriceEstimate = await promisify<string>(web3.eth.getGasPrice)();
console.log(gasPriceEstimate);
```
